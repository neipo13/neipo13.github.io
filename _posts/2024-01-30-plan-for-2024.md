## How 2024 will be my best year of Game Dev


### Outline/Key Points
* 2 steam game launches
* first game is free & pushes wishlists to the second
* focus on BUILDING:
    * game "Shell"
        * the stuff that a game NEEDS, that can be used for future projects with small revision
    * audience
        * find where my people are (discord/tiktok/yt/twitch) via experimenting w/ each & gauging response
        * branding & account lockdown on each social
        * re-brand the blog?
    * marketing funnel
        * email marketing
        * leveraging previous game's steam store pages + "ad" space in my previous games for my future ones
        * games & pages should push players to join newsletter/discord/etc actively
* plan for building
    * initial game in genre w/ 3 month timeline for release
    * support & gauge success in initial game
        * understand what people liked about it or didnt like
    * if success is found:
        * build content update while working on follow up
        * drop follow up game's steam page for wishlists
        * drop content update pointing to follow up's steam page for wishlists
    * if no success:
        * start over w/ new genre
* target genre: Survivor-like
    * sort of too late to the "fast-follow" but seems doable in the timelines
    * base game focuses on perk expansions of a single basic shot instead of expansive weapons
    * good for "shell" building in several other genres of interest to me
* target follow up option: rogue-like shooter
    * games like tiny rogues are still popping off
    * no major graphics needed to pop
    * shell built from survivor-like still applies
* target follow up option: action roguelike deckbuilder
    * how to market a game says deckbuilders have a high hit rate & adding some topdown action type work could make this fit w/ the shell built in the previous
